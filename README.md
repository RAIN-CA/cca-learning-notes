# 📓 Computer Control & Automation Learning Notes

Welcome to my **Computer Control & Automation (CCA) Learning Notes** repository!

This repository serves as a personal knowledge base where I document my journey as an incoming MSc student in **Computer Control & Automation**. All notes are written and organised by myself, covering key concepts, coding exercises, and personal reflections.

⚠️ **Disclaimer**  
These notes are for my personal learning and may contain mistakes or incomplete understandings. I will update this repository **according to my own learning pace and frequency**, rather than following any fixed course schedule.

## ✨ Goals

- Consolidate my understanding through hands-on practice  
- Build a structured and accessible knowledge base  
- Record insights from self-studying and exploration

## 🛠️ Topics Covered

- Programming (Python, C/C++, Java, etc.)
- Computer Control & Automation concepts
- Algorithms and data structures
- Machine learning basics
- Any new topics I explore along the way

## 📅 Updates

I will keep updating this repository whenever I make progress in my studies.
